Multi Step Form with Validation in React and TypeScript
This project demonstrates how to create a multi-step form with validation using React and TypeScript. The form collects user information across multiple steps and validates the input at each step before allowing the user to proceed.

## Features

- Multi-step form navigation
- Input validation for each step
- TypeScript for type safety
- Simple and clean UI

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multistepform.git
   cd multistepform
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Fill out the form fields in each step.
- Click "Next" to proceed to the next step after validation.
- Click "Back" to return to the previous step.
- Submit the form on the final step.

## Technologies Used
